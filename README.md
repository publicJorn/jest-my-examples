# Stupid simple Jest examples

> This is Work In Progress

Initially some mocking examples to get used to them

```
npm install
npm test
```

## Extra's

For Visual Studio Code it has a `launch.json` defined so you can run tests from the editor by pressing `F5`

## Contribute ?

Only dependency should be Jest
